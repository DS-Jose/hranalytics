## Understanding HR Requirements

*  Engaged end user Pinali to understand key questions around attendance, remote work, sick leaves
*  Discussed requirements for scheduling, office space optimization, health outbreak prevention
*  Ensured solution is tailored, sustainable and enables independent analysis

## Gathering and Transforming Data

*  Used Power Query to import, append sheets, standardize columns, clean data
*  Parameterized code for reusability, designed automated pipeline from Excel to analytics-ready structures

*  Modularized measures for reusability across visualizations and dashboards

## Dashboarding in Power BI

*  Created interactive dashboards with trends, drill-downs and context on metrics
*  Dashboards enabled self-service insights on attendance patterns and outliers
*  Gathered feedback from Pinali on potential dashboard enhancements
*  Download the PowerBI dashboard [here](HRDashboard.pbix)
